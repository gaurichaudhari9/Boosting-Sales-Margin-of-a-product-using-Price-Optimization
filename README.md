# Boosting Sales Margin with Data-Driven Price Optimization

## Introduction
This project, titled "Boosting Sales Margin of a Product using Data-Driven Price Optimization for E-commerce Platform," is an exploration into how data analytics and optimization strategies can significantly enhance the profitability of products sold on e-commerce platforms. By leveraging the Olist store dataset, this project delivers comprehensive insights and actionable strategies to boost sales margins through intelligent price optimization.

## Project Objective
The primary goal is to identify a product from a top-selling category and implement data-driven pricing strategies to maximize its sales margin. This involves extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of advanced analytical techniques.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Incomplete Records Analysis**: Investigated and addressed incomplete records in the dataset.
- **Duplicate Records Check**: Ensured the uniqueness of the dataset by checking for duplicates.
- **Order Status Filtering**: Focused analysis on 'delivered orders' to maintain relevance to the objective.

## Data Analysis and Insights
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough EDA to extract meaningful patterns and trends.
- **Feature Selection**: Identified key features that significantly impact the sales margin.
- **Price Optimization Modeling**: Developed models to determine the optimal pricing strategy for the selected product.

## Results
- **Improved Sales Margin**: Demonstrated a significant increase in the sales margin of the selected product through the application of the optimized pricing strategy.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Enabled informed decision-making by providing a data-backed rationale for pricing adjustments.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data analysis and modeling.
- Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Install required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis and results.

## Conclusions
This project showcases the power of data science in transforming business strategies. By applying data-driven price optimization techniques, we can significantly enhance the sales margin, demonstrating the potential of analytics in e-commerce.

## Future Work
- Expand the analysis to multiple products and categories.
- Integrate real-time data feeds for dynamic pricing strategies.
